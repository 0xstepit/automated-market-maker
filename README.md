# AUTOMATED MARKET MAKERS MODELS

This repo contains the implementation of different models of bonding curve underlying Automated Market Makers (AMM) :chart_with_upwards_trend: . AMMs are one of the building block of the Decentralisez Finance (DeFi) and their understanding is of paramount importance for a simple user and for a BUIDLer. This new kind of technological market are based on math, which provides all the tool to regulate and utomatize the complex behaviour of a market and, consequently, the relations amongst users.
